# Malware-Infected System Log Analysis

## ðŸ”¹ Project Overview
This project demonstrates the process of investigating a **malware-infected system** by analyzing its logs. The goal was to detect indicators of compromise (IoCs), identify the infection vector, and recommend remediation measures.

## Objectives
- Collect and analyze system logs from an infected host.  
- Identify suspicious activities and IoCs.  
- Document findings in a structured incident report.  
- Recommend remediation and preventive measures.  

## Process
1. Collected logs from the infected system:  
   - Windows Event Viewer logs (Application, Security, System).  
   - Antivirus/Endpoint detection alerts.  
   - Network traffic logs (via Wireshark).  
2. Looked for suspicious patterns, including:  
   - Multiple failed login attempts.  
   - Unexpected process executions.  
   - Outbound connections to suspicious IPs/domains.  
   - Unauthorized changes in registry/system files.  
3. Cross-checked IoCs with threat intelligence sources.  
4. Determined the malware type (e.g., trojan, ransomware, keylogger).  
5. Containment & remediation steps:  
   - Isolated infected system from the network.  
   - Removed malicious files/processes.  
   - Applied security patches.  
   - Restored clean backup.  
6. Documented all findings in an **Incident Report**.  

## Deliverables
- Malware investigation report.  
- List of identified IoCs.  
- Screenshots of suspicious logs/events.  
- Recommended remediation plan.  

## Skills Demonstrated
- Log analysis and threat hunting.  
- Incident response investigation.  
- Malware detection and remediation planning.  

## Tools Used
- Windows Event Viewer  
- Wireshark  
- Antivirus/EDR logs  
- Threat intelligence databases (VirusTotal, AbuseIPDB)
