# OpenSSL â€“ Digital Certificates (Generate & Validate)

## ðŸ”¹ Project Overview
This project demonstrates how to use **OpenSSL** to generate and validate digital certificates.  
Certificates are essential in cybersecurity for **authentication, encryption, and establishing trust** between systems.

## ðŸ”¹ Key Tasks
- Generated a **private key** and **self-signed certificate** using OpenSSL.  
- Created a **Certificate Signing Request (CSR)**.  
- Simulated validation of certificates.  
- Demonstrated how certificates enable **secure communication (HTTPS/SSL/TLS)**.  

## ðŸ”¹ Tools & Methods Used
- **OpenSSL CLI** for key and certificate generation.  
- Basic PKI (Public Key Infrastructure) concepts for trust validation.  

## ðŸ”¹ Deliverables
- Generated files: `private.key`, `certificate.crt`, and `csr.pem`.  
- Screenshots of OpenSSL commands and outputs.  
- Documentation explaining how SSL/TLS certificates secure web traffic.
