# Cryptographic Hash Functions â€“ Data Integrity

## ðŸ”¹ Project Overview
This project demonstrates the use of **cryptographic hash functions** to verify data integrity.  
Hashing is a critical concept in cybersecurity, ensuring that files or messages have not been altered during storage or transmission.

## ðŸ”¹ Key Tasks
- Generated hashes for sample files using algorithms like **MD5, SHA-1, and SHA-256**.  
- Compared hash values before and after file modification.  
- Verified integrity by matching original and calculated hash values.  

## ðŸ”¹ Tools & Methods Used
- **Hashing utilities** (Windows PowerShell, Linux `sha256sum`, or CyberChef).  
- Test files with deliberate modifications to simulate tampering.  

## ðŸ”¹ Deliverables
- Hash values of test files (original vs modified).  
- Screenshots of integrity verification.  
- Documentation on why **SHA-256** and stronger algorithms are preferred.
