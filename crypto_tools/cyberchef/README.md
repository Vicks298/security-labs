# CyberChef â€“ Message Encryption & Decryption

## ðŸ”¹ Project Overview
This project demonstrates how to use **CyberChef**, a web-based tool for encryption, decryption, and data transformation, to secure communication.  
The focus was on applying cryptographic techniques to ensure **confidentiality** of messages.

## ðŸ”¹ Key Tasks
- Encrypted plaintext messages using algorithms such as **AES** and **Base64**.  
- Decrypted ciphertext back to plaintext for validation.  
- Demonstrated **encoding/decoding pipelines** in CyberChef recipes.  

## ðŸ”¹ Tools & Methods Used
- **CyberChef (GCHQ)** for encryption/decryption.  
- Different ciphers (AES, XOR, Base64) to compare strengths and weaknesses.  

## ðŸ”¹ Deliverables
- Screenshots of **encryption and decryption processes**.  
- Example of a **CyberChef recipe** used for automation.  
- Documentation of how CyberChef can be applied in real-world scenarios.
