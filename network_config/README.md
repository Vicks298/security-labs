# Network Configuration Projects

This folder contains foundational networking projects that demonstrate configuring, securing, and testing enterprise-grade environments using simulation tools.

## Projects

### 1. IP Addressing & VLAN Configuration
- Configured multiple VLANs in a simulated network.  
- Assigned IP addresses and implemented inter-VLAN routing.  
- Verified connectivity between devices across VLANs.  

### 2. Network Simulation
- Used Cisco Packet Tracer to build and test a virtual enterprise network.  
- Simulated routing and switching operations.  
- Implemented connectivity tests to verify network resilience.  

### 3. Firewall Topology
- Designed a small office/home office (SOHO) firewall topology.  
- Configured ACLs and security policies for inbound and outbound traffic.  
- Demonstrated segmentation and restricted access to sensitive subnets.
