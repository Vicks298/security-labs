# Wireshark: Network Traffic Capture & Analysis

This project demonstrates how to capture, filter, and analyze network traffic using Wireshark. The focus was on identifying normal network behavior and detecting potential anomalies.

## Objectives
- Capture live network traffic from a simulated environment.  
- Apply display filters to isolate specific protocols (HTTP, DNS, TCP, ICMP).  
- Analyze packet-level communication between clients and servers.  
- Detect suspicious patterns such as abnormal connections or data exfiltration attempts.  

## Process
1. Set up a controlled network environment in Packet Tracer / local VM.  
2. Generated traffic (ping, web browsing, DNS queries).  
3. Captured packets using Wireshark.  
4. Applied protocol filters to highlight key communication.  
5. Documented abnormal patterns and their potential security implications.  

## Deliverables
- Screenshots of captured packets.  
- Analysis report highlighting findings.  
- Suggested remediation for suspicious traffic.  

## Skills Demonstrated
- Network packet analysis  
- Protocol filtering (TCP, UDP, ICMP, HTTP, DNS)  
- Identifying suspicious or malicious traffic  
- Basic incident detection using network forensics  

## Tools Used
- Wireshark  
- Cisco Packet Tracer / Virtual Machines  
- Windows/Linux terminal utilities (ping, traceroute, nslookup)
