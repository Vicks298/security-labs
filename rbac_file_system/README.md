# Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) â€“ File System Permissions

## ðŸ”¹ Project Overview
This project demonstrates how to implement **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)** in a simulated environment by configuring user and group permissions on a file system.  
RBAC ensures that users only have access to the files and resources necessary for their role.

## ðŸ”¹ Key Tasks
- Created user accounts for different roles (e.g., HR, Finance, IT Support).  
- Created groups and assigned users based on job function.  
- Configured **file and folder permissions** so that only authorized groups could access specific resources.  
- Tested access restrictions to confirm enforcement.  

## ðŸ”¹ Tools & Methods Used
- **Linux File System Permissions** (`chmod`, `chown`, `chgrp`).  
- **Windows NTFS Permissions** (for demonstration on Windows).  
- Concept of **least privilege** access model.  

## ðŸ”¹ Deliverables
- Screenshots of user and group creation.  
- Permission matrix mapping roles to resources.  
- Test results showing restricted and allowed access.
