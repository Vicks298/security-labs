# Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) â€“ Google Account

## ðŸ”¹ Project Overview
This project demonstrates how to implement **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)** on a Google account.  
MFA provides an extra layer of security by requiring a **password** plus an additional verification method (e.g., mobile device or authenticator app).

- Enabled MFA in Google Account Security Settings.  
- Configured **Google Authenticator App** to generate time-based one-time passwords (TOTP).  
- Tested login with both **username/password** and **MFA code**.  

## ðŸ”¹ Tools & Methods Used
- **Google Account Security Settings**.  
- **Google Authenticator / Authy** for TOTP codes.  

## ðŸ”¹ Deliverables
- Screenshots of MFA setup and login attempts.  
- Documentation of the step-by-step configuration process.  
- Explanation of why MFA reduces risks of unauthorized access.
