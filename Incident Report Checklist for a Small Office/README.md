1. Identified key incident categories:  
   - Malware infection  
   - Unauthorized access  
   - Data breach  
   - Network outage  
   - Phishing attacks  
2. Created a checklist covering:  
   - **Detection** â€“ How the incident was identified.  
   - **Containment** â€“ Steps to isolate the issue.  
   - **Eradication** â€“ Actions to remove the threat.  
   - **Recovery** â€“ Restoring normal operations.

   - Systems/users affected  
   - Description of incident  
   - Immediate actions taken  
   - Escalation steps  
   - Follow-up recommendations
